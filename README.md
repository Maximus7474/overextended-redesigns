## Contributing
 
To guarantee that every redesign listed here is safe, performant, and follows decent coding practices, we hold all contributors to a high standard.

Before opening a Pull Request, ensure your work aligns with our [submission guidelines](https://overextended-redesigns.vercel.app/contribute). Submissions are manually vetted; if a PR is incomplete or does not meet our quality bar, it will not be merged.

*Note: You must own the redesign or provide proof of authorization to share it. Please submit only one redesign per PR.*

## Development Guide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Commit Conventions

Contributors must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), proper commit messages ensure a clean and readable project history.

### Pull Request Process

Because github is picky on how to have multiple PR templates (even though they say you can -> [github pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)), please ignore the template and follow the one listed here below:
